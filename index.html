			<p>On this educational website, you can find information about LGBTQ+ flags, Pride's origins, and resources for LGBTQ+ individuals. Now, what does the title of this website, "Love is Love" mean? Love is Love is a phrase used to communicate that love means to love however you want. Falling in love with someone is not about the gender of the person; as long as you are happy with your partner, you deserve to love them.</p>
	
			<p>Why was this website created? For individuals that are part of the LGBTQ+ community, their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression have caused people to discriminate against them. Specifically, among LGBTQ+ youth, the challenges they go through due to family members, community members, and peers responding to their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression can cause LGBTQ+ youth to be more at risk for suicide and homelessness. Because of this, representation, equality, and education about the LGBTQ+ community are a must. </p>
	
			<p>By generating awareness and educating people about the queer community, "Love is Love" can help drive equality for all, especially for queer youth. </p>
